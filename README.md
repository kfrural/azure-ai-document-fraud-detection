# Azure Document Fraud Detection Template

This project provides a template for analyzing documents using Azure AI and detecting fraud. It serves as a starting point that requires customization to function properly.

## Project Overview

### Purpose
- Analyze documents stored in Azure Blob Storage
- Extract data from documents using Azure Form Recognizer
- Detect potential fraud patterns
- Train machine learning models for prediction

### Features
1. Document upload to Blob Storage
2. Data analysis with Azure Form Recognizer
3. Fraud detection logic
4. Model training for prediction

## Setup Instructions

1. Clone this repository
2. Install required dependencies:
   ```
   pip install azure-storage-blob azure-ai-formrecognizer joblib scikit-learn numpy
   ```
3. Configure environment variables:
   - Set up `AZURE_STORAGE_CONNECTION_STRING` for Blob Storage access
   - Create a Form Recognizer resource in Azure and obtain the endpoint and API key
4. Update configuration files:
   - Modify `config/config.json` with your Azure credentials and storage details

## Usage

This template provides a basic structure for document analysis and fraud detection. To use it effectively:

1. Implement document upload functionality (`upload_documents.py`)
2. Add document analysis logic (`analyze_document.py`)
3. Develop fraud detection rules (`preprocess_data.py`)
4. Set up alert notification system (`send_alerts.py`)

Each file serves as a starting point that needs to be customized based on your specific requirements and data structures.
